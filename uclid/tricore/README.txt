* src/ contains the UCLID5 specification of TriCore
* test/ contains all the auxiliary files, which fix the properties to verify, the constants and the initial conditions.
* all_smt.py implements the SMT-based heuristics.


The following commands enable to rerun all the experiments conducted for the FMICS 20 paper:
    Scalable Detection of Amplification TimingAnomalies for the Superscalar TriCoreArchitecture
and for the STTT paper:
    Formal Modeling and Verification for Amplification Timing Anomalies in the Superscalar TriCore Architecture

* Evaluations of various configurations (Table 6 in STTT):
$ ./tricore-notiming-anomaly.sh #cond ['smtLog'] ['before']
    'smtLog' produces the SMT files instead of calling the SMT solver
    'before' uses the stalling-before specific logic instead of whole

* Evaluation of the SMT-based heuristics (Tables 9, 10 and 11 in STTT):
$ python all_smt.py smt_filename 'approx'|'all'|'all_actual'
    smt_filename is the file that contains the SMT problem (SMT-Lib format)
    'approx': broad-spectrum incremental exploration (Algo 2)
    'all_actual': delay-scenario exploration (Algo 3)
    'all': basic (Algo 1)

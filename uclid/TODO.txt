- Check that inorder pipeline show a timing anomaly ...

- Compute delays to due to timing anomalies and specify the timing anomaly property
  using these delays only (not using stage or opcode)
  => WiP : computing delays is done but requires refactoring code between rules and instruction

- Specify PRET and Patmos rules

- Develop a version using prime variables for instruction module

- Develop a version with several subsequent instructions => should be
  generated from a description of a pipeline


NOTES

- Model branch behavior for the in-order pipeline? Do we model only a
  path of a program?

- In fact in the rules for a specific pipeline, we only look at instructions
  => they are not modified in those modules, only in the instruction modules

  So it migth be better to have instances of instruction in the module
  instruction in order to define generic rules in this module

- Compute delays to due to timing anomalies and specify the timing anomaly property
  using these delays only (not using stage or opcode)

- Specify PRET and Patmos rules

- Develop a version using prime variables for instruction module

- Develop a version with several subsequent instructions => should be
  generated from a description of a pipeline


NOTES

- Model branch behavior for the in-order pipeline? Do we model only a
  path of a program?

- Change names of test => remove sic. Generate instance of each pipeline
  by changing in the source code sic by inorder, etc. and put all this in a makefile
  to collect trace for each pipeline

- Fix timing issue using test-sic-check-nready_mem.ucl

- Specify PRET and Patmos rules

- Compute delays to due to timing anomalies

- Measure the time to perfom assume and checkings

- Develop a version using prime variables for instruction module

- Develop a version with several subsequent instructions => should be
  generated from a description of a pipeline

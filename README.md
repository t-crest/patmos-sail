# patmos-sail
Sail ISA model of Patmos

This is a common project between CEA LIST and DTU to describe the ISA
of [Patmos processor](http://patmos.compute.dtu.dk/) using the
[Sail language](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/sail/).

It is currently a WiP, starting from RISCV sail model.

An outline of the specification
-------------------------------

The model contains the following Sail modules in the `model` directory:

- `prelude.sail` contains useful Sail library functions

- `patmos_types.sail` contains some basic Patmos definitions

- more files will come in ...

Building simulators need to be checked later ...

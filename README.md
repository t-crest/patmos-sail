# Sail ISA model of Patmos
This repository will contain a [Sail](https://github.com/rems-project/sail)
description of the instruction et architecture (ISA) of
[Patmos](https://github.com/t-crest/patmos).

It is currently a WiP, starting from RISCV sail model.

An outline of the specification
-------------------------------

The model contains the following Sail modules in the `model` directory:

- `prelude.sail` contains useful Sail library functions

- `patmos_types.sail` contains some basic Patmos definitions

- more files will come in ...

Building simulators need to be checked later ...
